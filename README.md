The products are added from Mongo when adding a new user the credentials are sent to the back and a user token are sent forward and stored in local storage. At this point due to time constraints i have not link the cart to the user. Though i just display the email address of the login user on the home page from the back end.

The API keys have been placed in an .ENV file for safe keep
you would need to make your own .ENV the file it should contain

PORT=3001
MONGO_URI='you own API Key'
JWT_SECRET='iubhlafdrsfbeAILYa'

This is a project I am still busy on it was a bit of team effort but we are almost finished.
